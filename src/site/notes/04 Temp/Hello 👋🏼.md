I'm Saleh, an experience designer based in London.

I spent most of my professional life doing multidisciplinary design, startup consultancy, and content production. 

I enjoy concept-building and tinkering with gadgets. I like, when the time permits, to write, [build interactive stories and games](http://adventureinteractive.online/), [podcast](http://soundcloud.com/hyperstage), and design perfumes!

Currently exploring the realms of financial software development.
